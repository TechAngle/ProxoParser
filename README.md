# ProxoParser - Parsing Free Proxies from Websites 🌐

ProxoParser is a Python script dedicated to the task of scraping and parsing free proxy information from various websites. It relies on the use of two primary libraries, requests and bs4 (BeautifulSoup), to accomplish its web scraping functionality efficiently.

## Requirements ⚠️

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before using ProxoParser:

- requests
- bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
- colorama
- fake_useragent
- pyfiglet

You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:

```shell
pip install requests bs4 colorama fake_useragent pyfiglet
```
# Usage
1. Clone the ProxoParser repository to your local machine.

2. Configure the list of websites to scrape by editing the config.py file. This file should contain the URLs of the websites you want to scrape.

3. Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```
4. Wait while the script parses and collects proxy information from the specified websites.

5. Once the process is complete, the proxies will be saved to a file in the parsed directory.
